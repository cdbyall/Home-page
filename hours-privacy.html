Last Updated: July 22, 2025

Thank you for choosing "Hours for Shelby" (the "App"). Your privacy is a core principle of our design, and this policy is here to explain how we handle your information with the utmost respect and transparency. Our goal is to provide a calming, useful tool without compromising your privacy.

The Core Principle: Your Data is Yours
"Hours for Shelby" is designed to be a completely private, offline-first application. All the data you create and interact with is stored exclusively on your own device.

1. Data We Do NOT Collect
We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any of your personal information or usage data. This includes, but is not limited to:

Your name, email address, or contact information.

Your location data.

Unique device identifiers.

Any data from other apps on your device.

Analytics about how you use the app.

2. Data You Create (Stored Locally)
The App stores the following information directly on your device's local storage:

Time Entries: All clock-in/out times, session types (CORE/ACAP), and any additional hours you log.

Settings: Your preferences for themes, backgrounds, and pay period length.

Achievements: A record of which in-app achievements you have unlocked.

This information never leaves your device and is not accessible by us or any third party. It is used solely for the functionality of the app, such as displaying your calendar, calculating summaries, and generating timesheets.

3. Data Deletion and Control
You have complete control over your data.

You can delete all of your time entries and achievements at any time by using the "Clear All Data" button within the App's settings menu.

Uninstalling the App from your device will also permanently delete all of its stored data.
